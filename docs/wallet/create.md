# CREATE WALLET

In “My Profile” or “Profile Edit” there will be a button for the user to create a wallet

Clicking on the “Create Native Wallet” option will open a modal with a modal of 12 keywords, from which the user needs to copy and save these words on their device.

After copying these 12 words, the user can click on the “Next” button where he will be redirected to a modal, from which they will need to paste the 12 words that he copied in the previous process and create an access password.
