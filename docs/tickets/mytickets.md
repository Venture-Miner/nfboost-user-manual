On the home screen, the “my tickets” tab will be available, where the number of tickets that the user has on the platform will be available.

The user will be able to buy as many packages of tickets as he wants based on the packages available for purchase.

The purchase of packages with tickets will allow the user to win medals at the end of each round of the events in which he participates, where he can later go to the market and buy items to equip the team in the event
