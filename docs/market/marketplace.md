# MARKETPLACE

In the left corner of the screen will be the Marketplace button. In this environment, items and NFTs will be available for the user to equip the team and generate extra scores in the events that they are participating or want to participate in.

There are some differences between buying an Item or NFT:

- Item: Each item has a different cost, durability, or score bonus.
- NFT: Each NFT has a different cost or score bonus.

Items or NFTs unavailable for purchase, means that the amount available for sale in the marketplace has already reached the limit.
