# EQUIP TEAM

After editing the team, the user will be able to equip players on their team with NFTs or Items that were purchased on the “Marketplace” screen.

To do this, the user just clicks on the slot corresponding to the player and decides whether to equip an NFT or Item. It will then be redirected to a screen to equip.

The NFTs or Items may be removed and/or edited at any time by the user.
